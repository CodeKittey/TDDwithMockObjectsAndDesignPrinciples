-  the [paper] (https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Paper/mockobjects_emergingproperties.pdf?raw=true) and the [paper's presentation] (https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Slides/TDD-SOLID.pdf?raw=true)

Thanks to [Peter Rhys Thomas] (https://github.com/peterrhysthomas) for the Java porting of the TDD micro-exercises.
Thanks to [Emily Bache] (https://github.com/emilybache) for the Python version of the exercises. 
Thanks to [Sam Serpoosh] (https://github.com/Sam-Serpoosh) for the Ruby version of the exercises.
Thanks to [Arthur Almeida] (https://github.com/arthuralmeidap) for the PHP version of the exercises. 
Thank you all !

If you want to contribute to the porting of the exercises and the proposed solution, start looking at the original C# version for strong-type languages and at the JavaScript version for dynamic languages.
